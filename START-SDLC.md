# Start SDLC

Codex does not have a native `/sdlc` command. Start the loop explicitly.

## Paste This At Session Start

```text
Work in SDLC mode for this repo.

Before editing:
1. Restate the task in one sentence.
2. Set a scope guard.
3. State confidence as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW.
4. Use `gpt-5.5` with task-based reasoning: documentation `low`, coding
   `medium`, review/QA/security `high`, installs/configuration `xhigh`.
5. Define the red check first.
6. Define the prove-it gate before coding.

During implementation:
- Make the smallest useful change.
- Keep the work to one slice at a time.
- If setup/auth work is involved, prefer full access and capture the evidence.

After implementation:
1. Run the targeted checks.
2. Summarize the prove-it evidence.
3. Review the diff for risk and junk.
4. Do not commit until the checks are green.
